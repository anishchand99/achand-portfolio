This is the latest up-to-date verison of the website that is live on the github pages link. The website is responsive.
The blog post is named as post1.html. It is inside blog/post1. That folder has its own independent images folder and stylesheet. Shared resources such as fonts are in the root directory under the folder name fonts. 

The included files are index.html that links to the blog psot. There are images, css, fonts, and javascript. The javascript is used to make the navbar disappear on scroll down and again reappear on scroll up. Similarly, JS is also used to make the navbar responsive using media query. If the width of the device falls below the given value, the navbar links is replaced by a hamburger icon which can be clicked to reveal the menu. I have used CSS animations for the linkedin and github icons on the left side of the blog post linking to my accounts. Also I have added 'smooth-scroll' on the home page when clicking on the section links in the navbar which makes the experience rather neat and less abrupt.
